Given a random generator rand(5) which generates numbers between 0 to 4. How do you generate numbers between 0 to 6, I.e. Implement rand(7).

Answer: You can use rand (5) just to find the last bit of any number then use that function to set 3 bits (111 (2) = 7 (10)), something like:

int rand7 () {
    int fst_bit = rand5 () % 2;
    int snd_bit = rand5 () % 2;
    int thd_bit = rand5 () % 2;

    return fst_bit << 2 + snd_bit << 1 + thd_bit;
}
